# Data-Analysis-for-Importing-Dataset-in-Vaious-way-

# Objectives
After completing this lab you will be able to:

* Acquire data in various ways
* Obtain insights from data with Pandas library
# Table of Contents
* Data Acquisition
* Basic Insight of Dataset
* Data Acquisition

There are various formats for a dataset: .csv, .json, .xlsx etc. The dataset can be stored in different places, on your local machine or sometimes online.
In this section, you will learn how to load a dataset into our Jupyter Notebook.

In our case, the Automobile Dataset is an online source, and it is in a CSV (comma separated value) format. Let's use this dataset as an example to practice data reading.

* Data source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data
* Data type: csv
The Pandas Library is a useful tool that enables us to read various datasets into a dataframe; our Jupyter notebook platforms have a built-in Pandas Library so that all we need to do is import Pandas without installing.
